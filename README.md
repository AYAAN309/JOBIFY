React + Vite Starter
This is a minimal React setup powered by Vite, offering fast development with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and pre-configured ESLint rules.

Available Plugins
Two official Vite plugins are commonly used with React for Fast Refresh support:

@vitejs/plugin-react — uses Babel under the hood

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc — uses SWC for faster builds

Choose the one that best suits your performance and tooling needs.

ESLint Configuration
This template includes a basic ESLint setup for catching common issues. For production-grade applications, it's recommended to:

Use TypeScript for better type safety

Enable type-aware linting using typescript-eslint

To get started with a TypeScript-ready setup, check out the official Vite React + TypeScript template.
